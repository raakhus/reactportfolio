                        My name is Randy Aakhus. I grew up in Bakersfield, California. When I was young, I had extreme flexibility in my joints (still do
                            for some joints). My overprotective Mother decided I should not be allowed to play contact sports. For the
                        better part of my young, life I developed my skills at swimming and learning.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p id="textColor">  Swimming and school provided the opportunity to leave my hometown. I went to college at the University of California,
                            Santa Barbara. While attending UCSB, I qualified for the Olympic Trials, graduated with a degree in Economics,
                        and enjoyed the beach as much as I could.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p id="textColor">  After graduating, I became an Ocean Lifeguard with Long Beach Fire Department. This made me realize I did not
                            want to be a Lifeguard or any other type of public saftey employee. After the summer, I talked to my brother
                        and we started our own corporation called ACTS Services.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p id="textColor">The service we provided was to install solar panels on the roof of houses. Some time passed and I realized this
                        daily grind wasn't for me.</p>
                        <br />


                        <p id="textColor">Now I'm building webpages and learning more than ever about integrating different technologies to make meaningful web/phone applications.</p>
